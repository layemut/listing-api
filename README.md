  Heycar listing API
</h1>
<p align="center">With listing-api a dealer can upload new listings (JSON and CSV format) and user can query listing with dealerId or search all listings by make, model, color and year</p>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

> First of all, clone project to your local directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:layemut/listing-api.git
```

> Then, cd into project directory.

```bash
cd listing-api
```

> In project directory, execute the following command to test and package API into jar

```bash
mvn package
```

> After succesful packaging, there should be a jar in targer directory. Now execute the following command to run the API

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

That's all, you now have listing-api running locally on port 8080! üéâ

## üìñ Documentation

You can access the documentation after running the API on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

## üöè Roadmap

- [ ] Use redis(or alternative) for distributed cache.
- [ ] Internationalization for error messages maybe.
- [ ] Use pagination for listing and search. (data might get too big)
- [ ] Test coverage to %100 :)
- [ ] Use mapstruct(or alternative) for mapping from/to dto and entity. (for readability)
